# Plugins

Place plugin assets here so the backend and UI can load them.

- **Option 1:** Put `.zip` plugin archives in this folder.
- **Option 2:** Put extracted plugin directories here; each directory should contain a `plugin.yaml` or `plugin.yml` (and optionally plugin code/resources).

Plugins appear in the **Plugins** section of the left panel in the config UI. If you previously had a top-level `plugins/` folder, move its contents into this folder (`components/plugins/`).
